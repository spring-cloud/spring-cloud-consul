== Running the sample

1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Verify consul is running by visiting http://localhost:8500
3. Run `mvn package` this will bring in the required spring cloud maven repositories and build
4. Run `java -jar spring-cloud-consul-sample/target/spring-cloud-consul-sample-1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`
5. visit http://localhost:8080, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8080","host":"<yourhost>","port":8080}` results
6. run `java -jar spring-cloud-consul-sample/target/spring-cloud-consul-sample-1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081`
7. visit http://localhost:8080 again, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8081","host":"<yourhost>","port":8081}` eventually shows up in the results in a round robbin fashion (may take a minute or so).
