Spring Cloud Consul provides http://consul.io[Consul] integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms. With a few simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your application and build large distributed systems with Hashicorp's Consul. The patterns provided include Service Discovery, Distributed Configuration and Control Bus.

## Features

Spring Cloud Consul features:

* Service Discovery: instances can be registered with the Consul agent and clients can discover the instances using Spring-managed beans
 * Supports Spring Cloud LoadBalancer - a client side load-balancer provided by the Spring Cloud project
 * Supports Spring Cloud Gateway, a dynamic router and filter
* Distributed Configuration: using the Consul Key/Value store
* Control Bus: Distributed control events using Consul Events

## Quick Start

As long as Spring Cloud Consul and the Consul API are on the
classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableDiscoveryClient` will try to contact a Consul
agent on `localhost:8500` (the default values of
`spring.cloud.consul.host` and `spring.cloud.consul.port` respectively):

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@RestController
public class Application {

  @RequestMapping("/")
  public String home() {
    return "Hello World";
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }

}
```

A local Consul agent must be running.  See the https://consul.io/docs/agent/basics.html[Consul agent documentation] on how to run an agent.
